# DS-SF-30 | Final Project Part 2: Deck, Notebook and Presentation

## FINAL PROJECT 
OBJECTIVE: Data scientists frequently present findings to other teams, many of whom won't know anything about data science! The goal of the final project is to practice communicating data science findings clearly and effectively so that non-technical audiences can understand.

---

## DELIVERABLES
Deck and Notebook: Upload your deck and the Jupyter notebook you used for your analysis to your github account. By 6:30pm PST submit links to the deck and notebook via the form provided in slack.

In Class Presentation: You will have 5 minutes to present a deck with your analysis and findings in class. The target audience for the presentation is a non-technical audience. Pretend you are presenting to various different teams at your company. Specifically explain everything in plain language and avoid technical jargon.

## GRADING:
3/3: Excellent verbal presentation and deck design. Deck has few words on each slide, and questions listed below for each section were answered verbally.
2/3: Good verbal presentation and clean deck with no spelling/grammar errors. 
1/3: Verbal presentation was difficult to follow or hear. Deck had some spelling/grammar errors.

## DECK FORMAT:
Have 6-10 slides: 

Title (1 slide)
Include your name, company name, cohort # or dates, and project title. 

Background/Business value (1 slide)
State any context the audience needs for why you chose the project. What's the business value of the question you want to answer (if there is one)? Ex 1: Company X needs a segmentation of customers so we can optimize the purchase conversion funnel. 

Summary of Hypotheses, Approach and Findings (1 slide)
State what were you trying to accomplish (aka your definition of success). 
Did you accomplish that? 
What was your null hypothesis? 
State where you got the data, and steps you took for analysis. 
Was there data you considered but decided to remove? 
In one sentence state what your overall findings were. 

Details of Approach and Results (2-4 slides)
Create 2-3 visualizations using matplotlib, and include metrics. Remember to label each axis.
Approach
What algorithms did you try?/What was your model trying to optimize for? 
How does the model work? 
What worked? What didn't? Why?

Results and Metric 
What is happening in the chart? 
How does the chart either prove or disprove your hypothesis? 
What caveats have to be explained to best understand the visualization?
Why did you chose the metric you chose?

Conclusion (1 slide)
Restate your conclusion.

Next Steps (1 slide)
What next steps would you take with this project? 
Is there anything still to be determined?
What might your conclusions enable others to do?

## BONUS:
For extra credit, create an interactive demo w/your data.

## RESOURCES AND RECOMMENDATIONS:
Practice your presentation with a friend or family member. Outside feedback can help you identify gaps in your material.

Tips
Limit the amount of visuals and text on your slides for maximum clarity.
E.g., try not to use more than 2 visuals or 3-5 bullets per slide.
Clean & informative presentations > Fancy Presentations!
Keep your charts simple, and make sure they are clearly labeled.
Seaborn has a handy easy way to set figures into a "talk" context, which blows up the text and makes it easier to read: http://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/aesthetics.html#scaling-plot-elements-with-plotting-context-and-set-context
