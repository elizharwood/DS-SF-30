Steps involved in that include getting an idea of the range and distribution of the variable values, exploring any missing data (if any) and predict possible implications of that, exploring any outliers I find and possible explanations for their extreme values, and determining if there are any data points I would like to leave out of my model (either because of missing values or being an outlier). I will also plot variables against each other (one as Y, one as X) to see if any pair seems to be correlated, and calculate correlation coefficients for pairs that seem promising. "
